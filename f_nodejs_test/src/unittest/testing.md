# Assert function:
The assert computer statement is analogous to the statement make sure in English.
An assertion is a boolean expression.
A test assertion is defined as an expression, which encapsulates some testable logic specified about a target under test.

Eg:
function myfunc(a, b)
{
     assert(a <= 5 && b >= 17.1, "Your comments")
     â€¦
}

# Describe:
1.We use "Describe"  just  for the sake of understanding   the test purpose and
logically group the tests.
Eg:
describe('user',function(){
    
    describe('create',function(){});
    
    describe('update',function(){});


});
